          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing
            through Rome and Venice in the 17th and 18th centuries to the French
            House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf
            Gras," or fatted calf, followed France to her colonies. By the late
            1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with carriages
            and horseback riders to celebrate Mardi Gras. Dazzling gaslight
            torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the krewe's members and
            lent each event an exciting air of romance and festivity. In 1856,
            six young Mobile natives formed the Mistick Krewe of Comus, invoking
            John Milton's hero Comus to represent their organization. Comus
            brought magic and mystery to New Orleans with dazzling floats (known
            as tableaux cars) and masked balls. Krewe members remained
            anonymous.

          <h2>Traditions</h2>
          <p>
            Mardi Gras is about music, parades, picnics, floats and excitement.
            It's one big holiday in New Orleans! Revelers know to wear costumes
            or at least dress in purple, green, and gold, and adorn themselves
            with long beads caught from the floats of previous parades. You'll
            see a lot of crazy costumes, kids with their families are
            everywhere, and both locals and visitors having a great time. Parade
            goers will sit on the ground, throw balls, play music, eat great
            food and watch the crowds walk by between parades. On Mardi Gras
            day, the majority of non-essential businesses are shut down because
            of the celebration. Experienced revelers know to bring a large bag
            with them so they can haul away all the beads and trinkets they will
            catch from the parades!

          <h2>Around the World</h2>
          <p>
            There are many other places that hold large celebrations, like
            various cities in France, the Netherlands, Portugal and many, many
            more. Many places have distinct food traditions as well, such as
            pancakes on the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday in the UK (and other
            places).<br />
            The British pancakes are like crepes and the most traditional way is
            to serve them with lemon and sugar.<br />
            In Sweden, sweet rolls filled with cream, called “semla” are eaten
            on the same day.<br />
            In Poland, you’d enjoy “paczki“, filled doughnuts, on the Tuesday
            before Ash Wednesday.
