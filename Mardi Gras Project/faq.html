              No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It
              belongs to everyone. Do not believe the claims of businesses who
              offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi
              Gras website. Using the term “official” is just a way for vendors
              to sell their products or services to those who do not know
              better. Products or websites are not licensed by the government
              for Mardi Gras. Each individual parade krewe is responsible for
              all of its merchandise. In some parts of the country, official
              organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration, but this is
              not true in New Orleans.

              The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day
              (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras day (Fat Tuesday), however, is
              on a different day each year. Fat Tuesday changes every year
              because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat
              Tuesday is always the day before Ash Wednesday. Most visitors plan
              to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and
              stay through Ash Wednesday. Check out our dates page to see when
              Fat Tuesday will fall through the next few years.

              The weekend before Fat Tuesday is the prime time to visit New
              Orleans for Mardi Gras. This is the weekend when Bacchus and
              Endymion, two of the biggest parades of the season, roll down the
              streets of New Orleans. The streets are packed all day Saturday
              and Sunday with parade watchers. If you can stay longer than a
              weekend, Monday (Lundi Gras) and Fat Tuesday are also great days
              to experience Mardi Gras. Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on
              that Monday night, and the Zulu Lundi Gras festival goes on all
              day. On Fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and seeing
              all of the costumes and masks is a unique and thrilling
              experience.

              During Mardi Gras parades, seats aren’t a necessity. Most people
              at the parades will be standing or even jumping for throws—and in
              between parades, people are walking around and popping into local
              restaurants for a bite. However, we recommend Grandstands for
              people who may have trouble standing or walking for longer than an
              hour at a time.

              There is not a single official Mardi Gras theme since there is no
              single organization in charge of Mardi Gras. Each parade krewe
              decides on its own theme each year, which is often kept secret
              until the parade. Their costumes, floats, some of their throws,
              and their "official" Mardi Gras poster (if they have one) reflect
              this theme. For example, after 9/11, patriotic themes were
              popular. Most of the krewes are named after figures from Greek,
              Roman, and Egyptian mythology, but some are named after the
              neighborhood where they parade.

              There is a city ordinance in Orleans Parish that prohibits Mardi
              Gras from being commercialized, i.e., no advertising is allowed on
              floats or can be thrown from floats. In addition, some of the
              Mardi Gras organizations have events outside of their actual
              parade where sponsors can participate. These include Zulu’s Lundi
              Gras Festival, Endymion’s big bash before their parade, Metairie’s
              “Family Gras”, and the ticketed extravaganzas held after some of
              our parades (such as Bacchus, Endymion, Orpheus).
